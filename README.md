# BikeRebalancingModel
A program that I built based on an academic paper that presents a Mixed Integer Programming Algorithm for Urban Bike Share re-distribution 

For privacy reasons the company I worked with asked me to omit the data used for the model. For more information about the project please email me at baltschuler@college.harvard.edu
